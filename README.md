# decouplingArtifact
These are my GNU Octave scripts used for to simulate the 1H decoupling artifact 
in 15N CPMG experiments as described in the paper:  

*Removal of slow-pulsing artifacts in in-phase 15N relaxation dispersion experiments using broadband 1H decoupling*

I put them now on Github so that anyone can make us of it.  

# How to use

1. Install GNU Octave from 
a. *Windows users* [octave.org](https://octave.org)
b. *Mac users* [octave-app.org](https://octave-app.org)
c. *Linux users* using your package manager

2. Download my simulations scripts 
3. Start octave
a. from the command line in the directory where you saved the simulation scripts
b. as gui, then navigate within the app to the directory where you saved the simulation scripts

4. start the simulation by typing the name of the particular main simulation script sim*xxxx*
